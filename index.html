        <p>I'm a long time desktop applications developer, but am I going to be a good web developer?  Well, there are some factors in my favor.  First, I can sit and gnaw on a problem for <em>hours</em> until I have a solution.  I'm still learning the tools, so it's taking me longer than it should e.g. I'm using the Chrome debugger extensively, but didn't know that F12 toggled full screen display. Second, I'm a tool & shortcut collector.  I have a full tab of sites on my speed dial for "Bootcamp".  Once I learn a neat trick, it sticks with me, and I never do anything the hard way a 3rd or 4th time, because by that time I know a better way.  Third, I love logic and data.  I'm looking forward to learning JavaScript, Node JS, & React, to make the web <em>do</em> stuff.  I expect that some of the challenges are different: I don't really understand 'stateless' and 'async' as concepts.  I started building applications before mice;  PC users tabbed from field to field and didn't reach the submit button until they had traversed the whole form.  When the user could just mouse into random fields, the whole concept of validation had to be re-considered. Gotta love a challenge!
        </p>
        <p>For someone used to dealing with forms, the Contact form was <strong>not</strong> an easy tab. The Name field inherited a border and backround-image from "element.style" that I could NOT override. The Email field didn't, so the form looked half baked.  I finally ended up with "!important", but at least it <em>looked</em> OK.  Then I couldn't find an input for textarea (at least not under "input") and struggled with making a single line "input type="text" look like it had a box and a text area.  About that time, my son came by and showed me 'textarea'  And then he deleted all of the code that I had constructed for the Name field, and nothing broke. Well, I'm a newbie. </p>
        <p>The Portfolio tab was fun, although harder than I thought it would be.  I tried to save myself some editting tasks by looking for consistently sized images.  I figured Mandalas, which are circular, could be sized to any dimension.  My search for Mandala images led to adult coloring books with a wide variety of themes, but still a nice consistent proportions. I'm glad that I had Saturday's class on the CSS Grid before I tackled the layout.  I still had trouble getting the images to wrap left, but once I got that solved  with 2 images, it was easy to do them all without even needing rows.  I also added hover, 'tool tips', and links to the full sized images.  Print some out and spend some time with your crayolas!</p>
